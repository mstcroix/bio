## letter of introduction

In 2004, I finally made it to Sweden. The night I went with my sister and friends out of the Stockholm Train station, I finally found what I wanted: Design + Concept stores. And in the window is written: 
>Never create something unless is: necessary and useful
>but...
>..if you create something, do it beautiful
>
There I found my self reflected in that glass of the store: art + tech
My nicknname: @mstcröix
- M. St. Cröix is the surface (area) under that wave (curve) directed by me (x) in relation with you (y) and how I inter-act

	`$marco (x,y) | = Motte(x,y) + Santacruz(x,y) = Motte+Santacruz(x,y)$`
